# Image Matching Challenge 2022
##### Register two images from different viewpoints
---

## **Description**
The [Image Matching Challenge 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022/overview) Register two images from different viewpoints Kaggle competition is focused on developing computer vision models that can match pairs of images that show the same scene or object from different viewpoints. Specifically, the competition requires participants to develop algorithms that can register two images by estimating the 3D transformation that aligns them. The competition provides a dataset of image pairs along with ground-truth correspondences between the images, and participants are evaluated based on the accuracy of their registration algorithm. The goal of the competition is to promote research and development in the area of image registration, which has important applications in fields such as robotics, augmented reality, and remote sensing.

### **Data**

[The Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022/data) for the Image Matching Challenge 2022 consists of two parts: the training dataset and the test dataset.

- The training dataset contains 5,000 pairs of images, where each pair of images shows the same object from two different viewpoints. The images are stored as grayscale images in JPEG format and have a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. Each pair of images is stored in a separate directory, with the two images named as "left.jpg" and "right.jpg".

- The test dataset contains 10,000 pairs of images, with the same format as the training dataset. However, the test dataset does not have corresponding ground truth labels, which makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of different image matching algorithms.

Both the training and test datasets are provided as compressed ZIP files that can be downloaded from the competition page on Kaggle.

In this notebook, I provide an overview of the competition and comprehensive solution to the Image Matching Challenge 2022 Kaggle competition, providing an end-to-end implementation for the problem statement, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and submission.
